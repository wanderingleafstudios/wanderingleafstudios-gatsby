## Frequently Asked Questions

### What is your rate?

We don't have this public for a variety of reasons. Please [contact us](/contact) to schedule a chat on how we may work together.

### What is your evaluation cost?

We charge a one-time, non-refundable evaluation fee of \$500 USD. This covers the time required to discuss the project, review the existing codebase, and architect a project proposal / statement of work.

### What is your response time commitment?

If you are a client, we are committed to getting back to you within 24 hours. If you are not a client, we still strive to respond within 24 hours, but it may take 48-36 hours.

### Help! I need a rush job! Can you finish projects within 4-6 weeks?!

Unfortunately, no. We typically have other project deadlines, so don't have the resources to handle rush projects. However, it doesn't hurt to [drop us a line](/contact)!
